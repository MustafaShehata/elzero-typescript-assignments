# Elzero TypeScript Assignments Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions for the TypeScript assignments provided by Elzero Web School. The goal of this project is to apply TypeScript concepts learned throughout the course, ranging from basic type annotations to advanced generics and classes.

## Project Structure

The assignments are organized by weeks.


| Week | Lessons | Topic | Status |

| Week 2 | 12 - 21 | Data Types & Advanced Aliases | Completed |

| Week 4 | 32 - 38 | Classes Part 2 & Generics | Pending |
